  description: |
    ORAN O2-IMS (O-Cloud Infrastructure Management Service) API for managing O-Cloud infrastructure resources.

    This API provides endpoints for:
    - **Subscriptions**: Event subscription management for resource change notifications
    - **Resource Pools**: Logical groupings of infrastructure resources
    - **Resources**: Individual infrastructure units (compute nodes, storage, etc.)
    - **Resource Types**: Classification of infrastructure resources
    - **Deployment Managers**: O-Cloud deployment metadata
    - **O-Cloud Infrastructure**: Top-level infrastructure information

    ## Authentication

    This API supports mTLS (mutual TLS) authentication. Clients must present valid certificates
    signed by a trusted CA.

    ## Rate Limiting

    API calls are subject to rate limiting. See response headers for current limits:
    - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per window
    - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
    - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when the window resets
