# gqlgen will search for any type names in the schema in these go packages
# if they match it will use them, otherwise it will generate them.
# Note: We don't autobind smo package because WorkflowStatus in SMO is a struct,
# but the GraphQL schema defines it as an enum. Same for DeploymentStatus in DMS.

# This section declares type mapping between the GraphQL and go type systems
#
# The first line in each type will be used as defaults for resolver arguments and
# modelgen, the others will be allowed when binding to fields. Configure them to
# your liking
